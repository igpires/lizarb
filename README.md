# Liza

Liza is a light, experimental framework primarily developed to help study the Ruby language and the Ruby ecosystem.

It is a < 3000 LOC Core, which provides an abstract architecture for organizing Ruby code using systems.

It defines 3 top level constants [Lizarb, App, Liza] and works with any gem or app that doesn't need these constants.

## Author note

I am happy with the project and I am starting to focus on documentation.

I will be updating the website https://lizarb.org/ to include more vivid examples and tutorials.

## Installing

Install the gem by executing:

    gem install lizarb

You will get the following shims:

    lizarb --version
    liza --version
    liza -v

## REPL

Try Liza with IRB or Pry:

    liza irb
    liza pry

## Create a liza app

So you can run your experiments:

    liza new
    liza new project_1

Then enter your generated liza app:

    cd project_1
    liza help

Now you're ready to go and try some stuff!

## Running Tests

OK, one more thing!

> All controllers you generate come paired with a test file.

You can run the tests with:

    liza test
    liza test +ask
    liza test -run

## DevSystem

Generate a command

    liza generate
    liza generate command
    liza generate command my
    liza my
    liza my 1 2 3

Generate a system

    liza generate
    liza generate system my_deploy
    liza generate system my_agents

Generate a command in a system

    liza generate
    liza generate command
    liza generate command other
    liza generate command other place=my_deploy
    liza other

Gemify a system

    # TODO

Investigate the framework

    liza xxxxx
    liza generate xxxxx
    liza shell
    liza shell:loc
    liza shell:paths
    liza shell:eval "puts 'Hello, World'"
    liza shell:eval "log 'Hello, World'"
